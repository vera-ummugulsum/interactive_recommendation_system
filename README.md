# Interactive Recommendation System with Word Embeddings using Word2Vec, Plotly, and NetworkX

Welcome to this project!

I will be exploring how to build a model that can understand words in a mathematical way, such that words with similar meaninings that share certain charactertics belong close to each other in vector space.
That's a fancy way of saying that the mathemical representations for words that have some similar meaning are close to each other, and words that don't share a lot of meaning are further apart.
I will show that this model can be adapted to be used in a recommendation system, or as a discovery tool (i.e. we don't have this in stock, maybe you'd like this alternative?).

### To do this:
I will be using a data set of recepies to try and build an understanding between different kinds of words that make up ingredients that intern make receipes. This can be used as the recommandation system was a discovery tool for finding new kinds of ingredients.

## Project Breakdown

1)	Dataset
2)	Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing
3)	Word2Vec with Gensim
4)	Exploring Results
5)	Building and Visualizing Interactive Network Graph

### At the end of the project we can reach an interactive visualization tool to explore the word embeddings as seen below.
## I strongly encourage to download 'temp-plot.html' and explore this interactive tool on your browser.
